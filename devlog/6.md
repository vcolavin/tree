Alright my next immediate task is to devise the whole `tick` architecture. By
tick I mean, like, frame. This game should aim to run at 1 FPS

Side note I will never introduce ticks (the insect) into this codebase.

Basically there will be a tick function type:

```ts
type Tick<T extends BaseType> = (
  args: { thing: T; block: Block },
) => Partial<Block>;
```

An example tick function:

```ts
const tick: Tick<Person.Interface> = ({ thing: person, block }) => {
  if (isHungry(person)) {
    if (hasFood(person)) {
      // return a partial world state representing having eaten the food
    }

    const foodCoords = findClosestFood({ block, person });
    if (isAdjacent(foodCoords, person.coords)) {
      // person needs to take the food here
      // and returns a new world state
      // or block diff representing that
    }

    // take one step closer to food
    // return a new block diff
    // representing that step taken
  }
};
```

And a top-level `doTicks` type function:

```ts
const doTicksForBlock = (block: Block) => {
  const diffs = Object.values(block.contentDict).map((thing) => {
    switch (thing.type) {
      case AllTypes.tree:
        return Tree.tick({ thing, block });
      case AllTypes.person:
        return Person.tick({ thing, block });
      default:
        return null;
    }
  });
};
```

Note that the `Partial<Block>` return type of Tick is not meant literally, but
that it returns some sort of delta which will be a partial state of the world.

Looking at this code it seems pretty clearly inspired by Redux. Makes me think
there must be a clever way of composing tick types in this "reducer"-esque
function, but because this isn't a general purpose language idk if that would be
worth my time. Maybe though!

Anyways what you would receive is one set of changes per thing. Probably a lot
of things would do nothing, like in the case that a tree doesn't grow or die or
anything, or if a person continues to sleep.

But then comes the step of reconcilation, which sounds hard. Basically you'd
want to merge them all and flag conflicts. Like if two people try to eat the
same slice of cake, only one of them should get to. That sounds a lot like
initiative.

I don't know what the data type of the diff will be.

Oh wait we know the source of truth of the block is a structure like this:

```json
{
  "id1": { "type": "person", "position": [0, 0, 0] },
  "id2": { "type": "tree", "position": [0, 1, 0] },
  "id3": { "type": "tree", "position": [8, 3, 0] }
}
```

What if the block diff is the subset of those which has changed?

```json
{
  "id1": { "type": "person", "position": [1, 0, 0] }
}
```

Then we'd have the original and a list of diffs to apply. A naive implementation
would be to apply those diffs sequentially, like:

```ts
diffs.reduce(
  (memo, diff) => ({ ...originalBlockDict, ...diff }),
  originalBlockDict,
);
```

That might be good just to start, to collect the differences under one roof and
be able to build out around it. Then I can come back to it and do something more
intelligent.

What remains difficult, and unsolved by this naive scheme, is what to do when
two people try to pocket the same apple. In this scheme, both people would get a
reference to the apple in their pocket, but the apple's position (which is the
source of truth in this case) would only reference one of their pockets.

So actually that last step was collation, not reconcilation. Reconciliation
would be like traversing all the things and making sure their parents know where
they are, so to speak. That sounds like it could get expensive, so perhaps we
could have a list of potentially problematic child things that need reconciling.

_Then_ and only then would we be able to generate the mythical four-dimensional
array that's used for rendering.
