This was going to be an adendum to the last note but it got too long.

Maybe instead of blocks having contents which are dictionaries, they could be
three-dimensional arrays. This would make it easier to parse for rendering.

i.e., instead of this:

```json
{
  "coords": [0, 0],
  "contents": {
    "id1": {
      "id": "id1",
      "type": "tree",
      "position": [1, 2, 3],
      "leaves": {
        "id": "id3",
        "position": "id1"
      }
    },
    "id2": {
      "id": "id2",
      "type": "person",
      "position": [2, 3, 4]
    }
  }
}
```

They could be like this, with each individual coordinate containing a dictionary
of its contents.

```json
{
  "coords": [0, 0],
  "contents": [
    [ // z-level 0
      [{}, {}, {}],
      [{}, { "id1": { "type": "tree", "position": [0, 1, 1] } }, {}],
      [{}, {}, {}]
    ],
    [ // z-level 1
      [{}, {}, {}],
      [{}, {}, {}],
      [{}, {}, {}]
    ],
    [ // z-level 2
      [{}, {}, {}],
      [{}, {}, {}],
      [{}, {}, {}]
    ]
  ]
}
```

OR it could be something like this, where each coordinate has a list of IDs
which refers to a dicionary elsewhere.

```json
{
  "coords": [0, 0],
  "contentList": [
    [ // z-level 0
      [[], [], []],
      [[], ["id1"], []],
      [[], [], ["id3"]]
    ],
    [ // z-level 1
      [[], [], []],
      [[], [], []],
      [[], [], []]
    ],
    [ // z-level 2
      [[], [], []],
      [[], [], []],
      [[], [], []]
    ]
  ],
  "contentDictionary": {
    "id1": {
      // tree
    },
    "id2": {
      // person
    }
  }
}
```

Accessing the things at coordinate `[0, 1, 1]` would look like this:

```ts
block.contentList[0][1][1].map((id) => block.contentDictionary[id]);
```

I kind of like this. You have easy access to the list of top-level things on a
given map (useful for rendering), and also a dictionary of _everything_ within
that map. That's nice.

If the innermost arrays are actually Sets, adding and removing things becomes
easier. This will be a common operation for representing movement.

This structure implies that `contentDictionary` is the source of truth which
`contentList` is derived from.

One question I still have is... is it better for `contentDictionary` to be
totally flat, with all the things at the top level, or should it be a tree like
structure?

```json
// tree-like:
{
  "id1": {
    "id": "id1",
    "type": "tree",
    "position": [0, 0, 0],
    "limbs": [{
      "id": "id2",
      "type": "limb",
      "position": "id1",
      "leaves": [
        {
          "id": "id3",
          "type": "leaf",
          "position": "id2"
        },
        {
          "id": "id4",
          "type": "leaf",
          "position": "id2"
        }
      ]
    }]
  }
}

// flat:
{
  "id1": {
    "id": "id1",
    "type": "tree",
    "position": [0, 0, 0],
    "limbs": ["id2"]
  },
  "id2": {
    "id": "id2",
    "type": "limb",
    "position": "id1",
    "leaves": ["id3", "id4"]
  },
  "id3": {
    "id": "id3",
    "type": "leaf",
    "position": "id2"
  },
  "id4": {
    "id": "id4",
    "type": "leaf",
    "position": "id2"
  }
}
```

I think this is a major question people wrestle with when designing JSON schema.
We're talking about schemes for graph traversal. How much normalization do we
do?

Let's say for now that it's entirely flat. It might mean more mucking around to
retrieve all dependent objects but I think it might just be better to choose
something and move forward.

The problems I can foresee is when moving an object to a new block, you'll need
to do quite a lot of cleanup work ensuring it and all its dependencies make it
to that new block. If there was just one base-level object with a dependency
tree, it would be fairly trivial; you'd only need to change the `position` of
the base object and everything else would follow!

We also said that the `contentList` would be derived from `contentDict`. It is
easy to add and remove things from a dictionary, but accessing and updating the
list efficiently might become a bottleneck. Lots of cool stuff to learn though!
