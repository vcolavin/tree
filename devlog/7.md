I am going to run this project in the browser because the web is the best
application delivery product I know.

At first I assumed I'd use webpack because it's been the standard for so long,
but it seems like everyone is stoked on
[esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) now so I'll try and use that. It's
nice that the builds will run faster but that isn't all that interesting to me.

I remember when webpack had been around for a year or two, junior FE devs would
ask (as they were trained to do) "what's the next big thing?", and the response,
unique among front-end technologies, was "why would there be a next big thing?
Webpack works fine." Alas, we as a community couldn't let that stand and have
once again set about improving things. esbuild is the next big thing (for now).

I have a pretty simple wishlist for building for the web:

- TypeScript
- Scss (this might not even be necessary given how powerful vanilla CSS has
  gotten)
- gzipping and minification for prod builds
- Automatic reloading on file modification in dev mode (doesn't have to be full
  on hot module replacement)

Is that it? I think that might be it. I don't need jsx if I'm not using React,
but I might end up using React. Idk. The UI for this app is going to be pretty
simple and I don't know that I'll need a whole so-called UI runtime to support
that. Just a `<pre>` element with some text inside which gets updated roughly
once a second. That shouldn't be too hard to do with `innerHTML`.

I do have some interest in using more in-depth libraries like three.js or d3.js
to do some interesting visualization, but that is not the current goal.
