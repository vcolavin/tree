How shall I persist data?

The current method of saving and loading JSON files doesn't seem tenable. The
data has lots of relations but I don't know if it's a good fit for a traditional
RDBMS. I don't know much about databases, and this is not the usual CRUD app
that I'm used to working with, or that DBs tend to be advertised for. How do
games generally store save data?

Regardless of what I choose I think I should push on using the JSON files for
now and not get distracted with something which is, in the end, besides the
point. Not that it's not important, but it's just not very exciting and I could
easily get bogged down by it.

Two options, at a high level:

- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html)
  - https://deno.land/x/sqlite@v3.2.0
  - Without having done more research, my perception is that SQLite is an
    amazing project that emphasizes speed and simplicity. I like that it's
    embedded and has no separate process or server. That just sounds so nice and
    simple.
  - actually can SQLite do document store? https://www.sqlite.org/json1.htm
  - con: I'd have to learn at least some SQL
  - con: Would need translation layer between DB and in-memory JSON models
  - con: not sure if this data would be well-suited by a relational DB
- Some kind of document store like Mongo.
  - con: NoSQL bros were really annoying in like 2014
  - Do I really not need relations?
  - What about Redis

Really I'd want a cross between what I perceive as the speed and reliability of
SQLite for local storage, and the document storing capability of Mongo.
