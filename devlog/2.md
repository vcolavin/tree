Notes on how to generate blocks, store data

There's this idea currently of blocks, which are 10x10x10 cubes of things. I had
the idea that we would load 9 blocks at a time (your block plus adjacent
blocks), like this:

```
b b b
b x b <--- x is "your" block, where the cursor is
b b b
```

Xnd as the cursor moves within a block it stashes and loads blocks so there's
always a block of distance between the cursor and the unrendered edge of the
world. This is kind of how Minecraft does it, which is where I got the
inspiration for blocks.

```
b b b
b b x <--- cursor has moved to a new block
b b b

b b b b
b b x b <--- render new blocks!
b b b b

b b b
b x b <--- de-render old blocks and stash them, returns to status quo
b b b
```

This seems OK but breaks down if there is ever the concept of large objects
which can span multiple blocks. Like imagine a wide tree, or a river. I'm not
sure how to model multi-space objects but if one ever crossed a border and found
its contents split between two json files, that would be really difficult to
deal with and seems like it's asking for complexity.

What if instead there is some sort of much more granular loading and unloading,
with each coordinate handled spearately? Like

```
    s
  s s s
s s x s s <--- each space is loaded individually as you go
  s s s
    s
```

Hm. I'm sort of thinking this through now and I don't think it solves any
problems.
