I know I just said time for bed in the last devlog but I just had a brain blast.
I just want to make a note of it.

I was thinking about how not all actions are instantaneous. For example, moving
one square or eating an apple happen effectively immediately in this game, but
something like dancing or sleeping is more of a _state_ than an _action_. Or,
it's kind of both. And I thought about how I'd have to differentiate between
instant actions and those that took time. How much that would complicate the
model.

But actually, all actions take time. You initiate an action, like eating an
apple, and some amount of time later you finish eating the apple, and there is
some consequence to that, i.e. that you feel full and your apple has turned into
an apple core. Even walking to an adjacent square takes a little bit of time.

So actions don't have _cooldowns_. That's not the right way to think of it. They
have _durations_. It takes 300ms to get to the next square, it takes 500ms to
eat an apple. You don't have to track how long ago you did every single action
to make sure it's valid. You just have to track how long ago you started the
action.

This is great, it seems a lot simpler. There might still be a place for action
cooldowns eventually, but I think the base case will be well served by action
durations instead.
