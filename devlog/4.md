Let's think about architecture a little bit.

It would be nice if this ran on computers other than my own. It would also be
nice if it was completely self-contained and you didn't need to know how to code
or set up a dev environment for it to run.

The best application delivery method I know that suits those needs is the web.
Like, why can't this just be a web app, no need to download anything?

Downsides:

- I wouldn't get to use and learn Deno (although maybe could still run in the
  back-end? The main game code would run in the client though.)
- The front and back-ends would have to be decoupled, introducing a boatload of
  complexity. Would there be login/logout? Invite codes? Makes me tired just
  thinking about it, that's the stuff I do for my day job.
  - Actually, with the
    [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API)
    (only currently available in Chrome and Edge sadly) I could actually do
    everything locally as long as the user grants permission. That could work!

Upsides:

- Way more libraries like P5 or D3 or Three.js (why are all of these so badly
  named?) for drawing. Also get to use the Canvas API. Plenty of learning
  opportunities
- More familiar terrain for me.
- Maybe I could learn PWA stuff.

Ok I'm leaning towards doing things in the browser. I'd like to avoid React
because I know it so well, and lean on something new like three.js. For data
storage I could do SQLite and write to local files (or localstorage if file
access is not available). Nice. Ok I feel like I can get sort of excited about
this again.
