Alright cool cool. I'm trying out something new. Trying Deno, and also trying
again to do a Dwarf Fortress type thing. I'm really attracted to this idea, and
I have been for a long time, of a forest simulation. Something that you can just
walk through and observe.

Here are a couple earlier expressions of this desire:

- https://github.com/vcolavin/forest
  - This was an aborted attempt to design the thing as a RESTful Rails API. It
    was overengineered and I didn't have enough expertise to carry me through.
- https://github.com/vcolavin/nature-of-the-beast
  - This one is actually a finished project that I'm fairly proud of. Very
    different in form but I assure you it's the same thing underneath.

I've been watching a lot of Kruggsmash videos and I'm feeling inspired again.
Remembering the feel of point-and-click adventures I used to play with my mom,
the sense that there was always something hidden around the corner. I'm trying
not to get too bogged down with details as I go, which is a tendency I have.

I'm leaving notes to myself throughout the file structure as I go, little
reminders in the form of TODO comments

Here are some other thoughts in no order.

- This will not be object-oriented, even if it is in a literal sense about
  collections of objects.
- I'm just going to pass data around to functions. It won't be
  `thing.moveTo(coord)`, but rather `move({thing, to: coord})`
- Testing for right now will be sparse. I have to build the thing out a bit
  before I can understand what parts are worth testing
- The project is currently reliant on my bash version, that should be changed so
  that the scripts in `scripts/` run on zsh or whatever else.
