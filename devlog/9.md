I'm realizing that the clock system I suggested in the last devlog suggests a
system of classifying actions in order to track them, which doesn't currently
exist. I need to think about that a bit.

Currently a tick function looks something like this:

```ts
const tick = (person: Person) => {
  if (wantsToMove) {
    return {
      // new world state representing movement
      [person.id]: { ...person, position: newPosition },
    };
  }

  if (hungry && hasFood) {
    return {
      // new world state representing eating the food
      [person.id]: { ...person, hungerLevel: person.hungerLevel - 1 },
    };
  }
};
```

So all the actions are sort of implicit within the code. There is no action
_named_ move or eat, there is no explicit concept of moving or eating, there is
just a world state that is returned if certain conditions are met. I.e. if the
person is hungry and has food, the tick function will return a world state
showing that the person has moved.

Implicit in my idea for cooldowns for different types of actions would is the
notion of _types_ of actions. And also tracking the last time an action was
used.

Hm.

So let's say there's a set of standard cooldowns for a type of thing, and also
the person object can have overrides to represent different proficiency (like if
a person's move speed is faster or slower):

```ts
// some enumeration of all possible actions
enum ActionTypes {
  grow = "grow", // like for plants
  walk = "walk",
  eat = "eat",
  chopWood = "chopWood",
}

// a default set of cooldowns for a type of thing
const personCooldowns = {
  [ActionTypes.walk]: 300,
  [ActionTypes.eat]: 1000,
  [ActionTypes.chopWood]: 2000,
};

interface BaseThing {
  // action cooldowns and last used become a part of every thing
  actions: Record<ActionTypes, { cooldown?: number; lastUsed: number }>;
}

// this represents an instance of a person
const person: Person = {
  actions: {
    [ActionTypes.walk]: {
      // this particular person has a faster than default walk speed
      cooldown: 200,

      // this is the most recent tick on which the action was taken by this individual
      lastUsed: 500,
    },
    [ActionTypes.eat]: {
      // this person has the default cooldown,
      // so there is no cooldown listed here
      lastUsed: 1000,
    },
  },
};
```

With that in place, performing an action has two more steps: checking whether
that action is cooled down, and after the action is taken, recording that in the
actions manifest.

Note here that I'm making some assumptions about what's available via global
state. I think `currentTick` and `framerate` should be available everywhere.
Yeah it's not purely functional but it would be a pain in the butt to pass those
around everywhere.

```ts
const cooledDown = (
  thing: BaseThing,
  action: ActionTypes,
  defaultCooldowns: DefaultCooldowns
): boolean => {
  const cooldown = thing.actions[action].cooldown || defaultCooldowns[action];

  // this math says
  // if the current tick is greater than
  // the time since last used plus its cooldow
  // then the action is cooled down, and thus can be used
  return (
    currentTick > thing.actions[action].lastUsed + (cooldown / 1000) * framerate
  );
};

const tick = (person: Person) => {
  if (wantsToMove && cooledDown(person, ActionTypes.move, personDefaults)) {
    return {
      // new world state representing movement
      [person.id]: {
        ...person,
        position: newPosition,
        actions: {
          ...actions,
          [ActionTypes.move]: {
            cooldown: person.actions[ActionTypes.move].cooldown,
            lastUsed: currentTick,
          },
        },
      },
    };
  }
};
```

And that's just for one action! It's a lot of typing. But updating the action's
`lastUsed` marker doesn't have to be that complicated if we abandon the
non-mutation principle, which isn't really getting us anything here. I hope I'm
not wrong on that.

```ts
const tick = (person: Person) => {
  if (wantsToMove && cooledDown(person, ActionTypes.move)) {
    person.actions[ActionTypes.move].lastUsed = currentTick;

    return {
      [person.id]: {
        ...person,
        position: newPosition,
      },
    };
  }
};
```

And hey if we're modifying the person object in place like that, why not...

```ts
const tick = (person: Person) => {
  if (wantsToMove && cooledDown(person, ActionTypes.move)) {
    person.actions[ActionTypes.move].lastUsed = currentTick;
    person.position = newPosition;

    return { [person.id]: person };
  }
};
```

Whew, it definitely looks simpler but it's a pretty big departure. Actually, I
think there was a reason I was being so stringent about non-mutation in the tick
functions, so maybe this isn't the path I should take. You wouldn't want actors
to be able to change each other's state unexpectedly.

Actually yeah let's back up a little, there's gotta be a nicer way to update an
action's most recent usage. It seems annoying that it has to be done "manually"
for every action. Why would I have to remember to write it?

The actor could simply return some description of action intention, not a new
world state. And then, based on whether that action actually takes place (part
of the reconciliation step), the `lastUsed` thing gets updated.

So like:

```ts
const tick = (person: Person) => {
  if (wantsToMove && cooledDown(person, ActionTypes.move)) {
    return {
      actionType: ActionTypes.move,
      data: { thing: person, position: newPosition },
    };
  }
};

// then later during the main game loop:
const actions = things.map((thing) => tick(thing));

actions.forEach((action) => {
  // apply action to the main block object
  // and update the actor's last use of that action
});
```

Alright now it's clear I'm just reinventing Redux. Fucking... Christ. Should I
just `import redux` then? No probably not, it's reconciliation is just taking
the most recent change. Anything more complicated, like making sure resources
are normalized and de-duplicated and whatnot, which is the hard part, I'd have
to build myself anyways.

I'm tired, man. Time for bed.
